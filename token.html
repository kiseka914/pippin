      <h1>$PIPPIN token</h1>
      <p>
        Welcome to the inspiration behind our ecosystem—the $PIPPIN Token.
        Inspired by a simple SVG design, our token serves as the lifeblood that
        connects our community and fuels our projects.
      </p>

      <h2>Backstory</h2>
      <p>
        The genesis of our token is a tale of creativity and community. It all
        began with AI-generated SVGs, where a whimsical unicorn image sparked an
        unexpected phenomenon. Named "Pippin" by ChatGPT, this image became the
        face of a new meme coin on Ethereum. This initial spark led to the
        creation of Yohei's first Ethereum wallet, the acquisition of tokens on
        the market, and ultimately the decision to develop Pippin into an AI
        influencer. Leveraging Yohei's experience with BabyAGI—the first popular
        open-source autonomous agent with task-planning capability, boasting 20k
        GitHub stars and over 70 academic citations— a thriving community formed
        on Telegram and X, centered around Pippin the unicorn, and the upcoming
        autonomous being framework that will power our favorite AI unicorn.

          <p>
            <i
              ><strong>Not financial advice.</strong> Memecoins are a highly
              volatile asset and it is recommended that you do not invest more
              into this asset category than you are willing to lose. They have
              clearly been a catalyst for a new breed of AI influencers, and
              purchasing related memecoins and joining the community is a great
              way to learn and understand the movement. If you are looking to
              dabble, the $PIPPIN community welcomes you!</i
